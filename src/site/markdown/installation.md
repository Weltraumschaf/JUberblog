# Installation

There are two ways of get JUberblog:

1. downlaod prebuilt binary
2. build it from source

## Download or Build

You can  either choose to download  a prebuilt binary  or you can build  it from
scratch.

### Download

TODO
<!--The prebuilt binary downlaod is [here][dist].-->

### Build From Source

If you want to build from source you need some build tools as prerequisites:

1. you need [git][git] to checkout the source (alternative you may download the source tarball from GitHub)
2. for compiling the sources you need [Java 7 JDK][jdk] or newer
3. also you need [Maven 3][mvn] as build tool

First clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Weltraumschaf/JUberblog.git

Then build the project:

    $ cd JUberblog
    $ mvn clean install
    
This will install the final binary (`juberblog.jar`) in the `bin/` directory.

## Setup Your Blog

Your blog setup will consist of three components:

1. the JUberblog command line tool (you built/downloaded that according the previous section)
2. the "data storage" of your blog
3. a webserver which serves your blog


The  basic idea  is that  you have  a data  storage where  you put  the content  as
[Markdown  files][markdown].  Then you  use  the  JUberblog  command line  tool  to
generate static  HTML from  these files.  And finaly your  web server  serves these
static files.

### Create the Scaffold

JUberblog requires  a particular  direcotry layout  as storage  place of  your blog
content. You may configre this in various  ways. But for the first steps you should
use the  defaults. To create  this structure  JUberblog provides the  `install` sub
command.


Create the initial scaffold directory for your blog data:

    $ mkdir -p /where/you/want/to/store/your/blog
    $ juberblog install -l /where/you/want/to/store/your/blog
    $ cd /where/you/want/to/store/your/blog

An optional step  is making this direcotry a version  controlled repository. If you
set up  your blog only on  a single machine  (everything is done on  this machine),
then  this  is not  necessary.  But  I recommend  it  because  this gives  you  the
"feature" of versioning  of your content. In the examples  here [Git][git] is used.
You may use other tools like Subversion, Mercurial, Darcs etc.

(optional) Make the blog storage direcotry a repository:

    $ git init
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit."
